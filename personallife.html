<p class="fadein">Homer's personal life includes him and his kids. He works as a nuclear safety inspector for the Springfield Power Plant. He has a sort of <br> negative relationship with Bart, he refers to him as "the boy" while Bart refers to Homer as his first name. At <br>other times, though, they can be very happy and have a great time. It really just depends on the time of day.</p>
